# Council Design — Design Your Evaluation Council

A planning skill that guides the user through designing a custom evaluation council. Two phases: conversational discovery → structured design → plan, then implementation via research/generate/document agents.

Plan mode handles the plan file natively — no manual file writing needed.

<progress>
- [ ] Step 1: Enter plan mode
- [ ] Step 2: Dream extraction (conversation)
- [ ] Step 3: Propose agent roster (structured questions)
- [ ] Step 4: Per-agent configuration (structured questions)
- [ ] Step 5: Architecture confirmation + exit plan mode
- [ ] Step 6: Implementation (post-approval)
</progress>

## Step 1: Enter Plan Mode

```
EnterPlanMode
```

## Step 2: Dream Extraction

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask first:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What domain should this council evaluate?"
  header: "Council Domain"
  options:
    - label: "Public goods projects"
      description: "General-purpose evaluation for funding decisions"
    - label: "DeFi protocols"
      description: "Evaluate DeFi projects on security, TVL, governance"
    - label: "L2 rollups"
      description: "Evaluate Layer 2 scaling solutions"
    - label: "Research grants"
      description: "Evaluate academic/applied research proposals"
    - label: "Other"
      description: "Describe your domain"
```

Store the answer as `$DOMAIN`. If "Other", use a follow-up text question.

Invoke the conversation sub-skill:

```
<skill name="council:design-conversation" args="$DOMAIN" />
```

(If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided, use it directly as the args.)

This runs a pure conversational dialogue — no structured questions, no tools. It returns a summary with:
- **Domain** — what we're evaluating
- **Purpose** — what decision this informs
- **Data priorities** — top data sources
- **Evaluation priorities** — the lenses that matter
- **Skeptic focus** — domain-specific red flags
- **Out of scope** — what the council won't assess
- **Core essence** — the ONE non-negotiable

Store these as context for the structured phase.

## Step 3: Propose Agent Roster

Based on the conversation, propose a default agent roster. First discover what already exists on disk, then present a proposed roster for approval.

### Discover existing agents

```
Glob agents/data-*.md → existing data agents
Glob agents/eval-*.md → existing eval agents
Glob agents/synth-*.md → existing synth agents
```

Read each agent's frontmatter to get name + description. These are the "existing" agents — they already have definitions and don't need research/generation.

### Q1: Data sources

Present the proposed roster as a single confirmation. Include all existing data agents plus any domain-specific suggestions from the conversation:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Here's the proposed data-gathering roster. Any changes?"
  header: "Wave 1 — Data Gathering"
  options:
    - label: "Looks good"
      description: "Keep this roster"
      preview: |
        Proposed data agents:
        ├─ data-github: GitHub activity, contributors, maintenance (existing)
        ├─ data-web: Website, docs, team, communications (existing)
        ├─ data-funding: Funding history from Gitcoin/RetroPGF/etc (existing)
        ├─ data-onchain: Contracts, TVL, users, on-chain metrics (existing)
        [├─ data-{suggestion}: {description} (NEW — from conversation)]
        └─ ...
    - label: "Add an agent"
      description: "I need a data source not listed here"
    - label: "Remove an agent"
      description: "Drop one of the listed agents"
```

If "Add" → ask: "What data source should this agent search? Give it a name (e.g., 'audits', 'discourse', 'l2beat')." Add to the roster, re-present Q1.
If "Remove" → ask which one. Remove from roster, re-present Q1.
If "Looks good" → store `$DATA_AGENTS` and proceed.

### Q2: Evaluation lenses

Same pattern — present existing eval agents plus conversation-driven suggestions:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Here's the proposed evaluation roster. Any changes?"
  header: "Wave 2 — Evaluation"
  options:
    - label: "Looks good"
      description: "Keep this roster"
      preview: |
        Proposed eval agents:
        ├─ eval-technical: Code quality, maintenance, contributor health (existing)
        ├─ eval-community: Users, governance, ecosystem integration (existing)
        ├─ eval-financial: Funding diversity, sustainability, efficiency (existing)
        ├─ eval-impact: Public goods properties, counterfactual impact (existing)
        ├─ eval-skeptic: Red flags, gaming vectors, reasons NOT to fund (existing)
        [├─ eval-{suggestion}: {description} (NEW — from conversation)]
        └─ ...
    - label: "Add an agent"
      description: "I need an evaluation lens not listed here"
    - label: "Remove an agent"
      description: "Drop one of the listed agents"
```

Same add/remove/confirm loop. Store `$EVAL_AGENTS`.

### Q3: Synthesis approach

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "How should evaluations be synthesized into a final output?"
  header: "Wave 3 — Synthesis"
  options:
    - label: "Single chair"
      description: "One synthesizer produces a unified report with recommendation"
      preview: |
        Keeps: synth-chair (existing)
        Creates: nothing new

        The default approach. A single synth-chair agent reads all evaluations
        and produces a score card, areas of agreement/disagreement, key risk,
        and a FUND / FUND WITH CONDITIONS / DON'T FUND recommendation.
    - label: "Debate format"
      description: "Bull and bear synthesizers argue, then a chair decides"
      preview: |
        Keeps: synth-chair (existing — becomes the final arbiter)
        Creates: synth-bull (NEW), synth-bear (NEW)

        Three synth agents: synth-bull (strongest case FOR), synth-bear
        (strongest case AGAINST), and synth-chair (weighs both arguments
        and renders verdict). More nuanced but slower.

        Wave 3 runs in two sub-waves:
        3a: synth-bull + synth-bear (parallel) → write to council-out/$SLUG/synth/
        3b: synth-chair reads both arguments + all evaluations → writes REPORT.md

        NOTE: The generated synth-chair for debate format will self-sequence —
        it polls TaskList for bull + bear completion before synthesizing.
    - label: "Ranked comparison"
      description: "Compare the evaluated project against alternatives"
      preview: |
        Removes: synth-chair (replaced)
        Creates: synth-ranker (NEW)

        A synth-ranker agent places the project in context of similar
        projects in the domain. Useful when evaluating multiple projects
        for a limited funding pool.
```

Store selections as `$DATA_AGENTS`, `$EVAL_AGENTS`, `$SYNTH_APPROACH`.

## Step 4: Per-Agent Configuration

For each selected agent, ask targeted questions to configure dimensions and sources. Batch by wave.

### Data agents (single batched AskUserQuestion)

For each NEW data agent (not one already discovered on disk in Step 3):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What specific sources should data-[name] search?"
  header: "Configure: data-[name]"
  type: text
  placeholder: "e.g., specific APIs, websites, databases, search queries"
```

### Eval agents (single batched AskUserQuestion)

For each NEW eval agent (not one already discovered on disk in Step 3):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What 5 scoring dimensions should eval-[name] use?"
  header: "Configure: eval-[name]"
  type: text
  placeholder: "e.g., 'Validator diversity, Token distribution, Upgrade mechanism, Governance participation, MEV resistance'"
```

For existing agents (discovered in Step 3), skip — their definitions are already written.

### Synth agents (if non-default approach)

If the user chose "Debate format" in Q3, three synth agents are needed: `synth-bull`, `synth-bear`, and `synth-chair`. The existing `synth-chair` can be kept as-is. For the new ones:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "For the debate format — what makes a strong case FOR funding in this domain?"
  header: "Configure: synth-bull"
  type: text
  placeholder: "e.g., 'Emphasize growth metrics, community adoption, technical innovation, and ecosystem value'"
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What makes a strong case AGAINST funding? What should the bear advocate focus on?"
  header: "Configure: synth-bear"
  type: text
  placeholder: "e.g., 'Emphasize sustainability risks, competition, team concerns, and alternative allocation'"
```

If the user chose "Ranked comparison", one new agent is needed: `synth-ranker`. The existing `synth-chair` is replaced:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What projects or benchmarks should the ranker compare against?"
  header: "Configure: synth-ranker"
  type: text
  placeholder: "e.g., 'Compare against top 5 projects in the same category by TVL, users, and funding received'"
```

Note: "Ranked comparison" replaces synth-chair. Mark `synth-chair` for removal in the plan.

## Step 5: Architecture Confirmation

Present the complete plan for approval:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Council design complete. Review and approve?"
  header: "Council Design"
  options:
    - label: "Approve plan"
      description: "Proceed to implementation"
      preview: |
        ┌─ COUNCIL DESIGN ────────────────────────┐
        │ Domain: [domain from conversation]       │
        │ Purpose: [purpose from conversation]     │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

        Wave 1 — Data Gathering ([N] agents):
        ├─ [name]: [what it fetches]
        ├─ [name]: [what it fetches]
        └─ ...

        Wave 2 — Evaluation ([M] agents):
        ├─ [name]: [lens] — [5 dimensions]
        ├─ [name]: [lens] — [5 dimensions]
        └─ ...

        Wave 3 — Synthesis ([K] agents):
        └─ [name]: [output format]

        Implementation steps:
        1. Research each NEW agent's domain ([P] agents to research)
        2. Generate agent definitions from research ([P] agents to create)
        3. Generate per-agent documentation ([P] new docs)
        4. Update evaluate skill + README

        Existing agents to keep: [list defaults being reused]
        Existing agents to remove: [list defaults not selected]
        New agents to create: [list new agents]

        Estimated artifacts:
        ├─ research/{name}.md × [P]
        ├─ agents/{name}.md × [P new]
        ├─ docs/{name}.md × [P new]
        └─ Updated: README.md
    - label: "Revise"
      description: "Go back and change selections"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Discard and exit"
```

If "Revise" → loop back to Step 3.
If "Cancel" → ExitPlanMode, report "Council design cancelled."

## Step 5 (continued): Exit Plan Mode

After approval:

```
ExitPlanMode
```

The plan file is written automatically by plan mode. Present to the user:

```
Council design complete.

Review the plan, then approve to begin implementation. Implementation will:
1. Research [P] new agent domains (parallel)
2. Generate [P] agent definitions (parallel)
3. Generate [P] documentation pages (parallel)
4. Remove [R] deselected agents
5. Update README
```

## Step 6: Implementation (Post-Approval)

**STOP HERE.** Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves (e.g., "approve", "go", "looks good", "implement it"). If the user wants changes, re-enter plan mode and revise. If the user says nothing related to approval, ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Ready to implement the council design?"
  header: "Implement"
  options:
    - label: "Implement now"
      description: "Research, generate, and document all new agents"
    - label: "Let me review first"
      description: "I'll read the plan and get back to you"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Discard the plan"
```

If "Let me review" → stop and wait for the user to come back.
If "Cancel" → report "Council design cancelled."

After the user approves, execute the plan:

### 6a: Research wave (parallel)

Use the plan content from the conversation context to find all agents with `Status: new`.

```bash
mkdir -p research
```

For each NEW agent, spawn a research agent in the background:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Research [agent-name]",
  prompt="
    You are researching the domain for a council agent.

    Agent: [agent-name]
    Purpose: [purpose from plan]
    Research needed: [research brief from plan]

    Research the domain using WebSearch and WebFetch:
    - Best practices for [evaluating/gathering] [domain]
    - Available data sources, APIs, scoring methodologies

    Write findings to research/[agent-name].md with sections:
    - Domain Context (2-3 paragraphs)
    - Data Sources Found (with URLs, access methods)
    - Methodology Notes
    - Key Findings (bullets)
    - Gaps (what couldn't be found)
  "
)
```

Spawn ALL research agents in a **single message** for parallelism. Wait for all to complete.

### 6b: Generate wave (parallel)

For each NEW agent, determine its template file from the prefix:
- `data-*` → use `skills/generate-agent/templates/data.md`
- `eval-*` → use `skills/generate-agent/templates/eval.md`
- `synth-*` → use `skills/generate-agent/templates/synth.md`

Spawn a generation agent for each:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Generate [agent-name]",
  prompt="
    Generate the agent definition for [agent-name].

    Read these files:
    1. research/[agent-name].md — domain expertise from research
    2. skills/generate-agent/templates/[data|eval|synth].md — use as structural template

    Agent config from plan:
    - Purpose: [purpose]
    - Dimensions/Sources: [dimensions or sources]
    - Status: new

    Write the agent definition to agents/[agent-name].md following the
    exact frontmatter + body pattern of the template:

    Frontmatter must have: name, description, tools.
    For eval agents, tools MUST include: Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, SendMessage, TaskUpdate, TaskList
    (evaluators need web access to independently verify claims — not just read data files).
    For data agents, tools should match the template's tool list.
    For synth agents, tools should match the template's tool list.

    Body structure for data agents: title, role description, Input ($PROJECT, $OUTPUT_DIR),
    Process (TaskUpdate claim → search/fetch → normalize → write → TaskUpdate complete →
    SendMessage), Output Format (markdown template with tables), edge cases.

    Body structure for eval agents: title, role description, Input ($PROJECT, $DATA_DIR,
    $OUTPUT_DIR), Process (TaskUpdate claim → read data → **independently verify key claims
    using WebSearch/WebFetch** → score dimensions with cited evidence → composite →
    write → TaskUpdate complete → SendMessage), Scoring table, Output Format, Score calibration
    (9-10 exceptional / 7-8 strong / 5-6 adequate / 3-4 weak / 1-2 critical).

    CRITICAL — Objectivity requirements for eval agents:
    - Every score MUST cite specific evidence, not impressions
    - Agents MUST flag when data is missing or unverifiable rather than guessing
    - Agents MUST note Goodhart risks: where the metric could be gamed
    - Agents SHOULD independently verify data agent claims where possible
    - The tools list MUST include WebSearch and WebFetch so evaluators can do
      their own research — they should not be limited to reading data agent output

    Body structure for synth agents: title, role description, Input ($PROJECT, $EVAL_DIR,
    $OUTPUT_PATH), Process (TaskUpdate claim → read evals → extract scores → find
    agreement/disagreement → synthesize → write → TaskUpdate complete → SendMessage),
    Output Format, Decision criteria.
  "
)
```

Spawn ALL in a single message. Wait for all to complete.

### 6c: Documentation wave (parallel)

For each NEW agent, spawn a doc agent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Document [agent-name]",
  prompt="
    Generate documentation for agent [agent-name].

    Read these files:
    1. agents/[agent-name].md — the agent definition
    2. research/[agent-name].md — domain context

    Write docs/[agent-name].md covering:
    - What this agent does (plain language)
    - Data sources or scoring dimensions (with details)
    - Output location and structure
    - How to customize it
    - Dependencies (what it reads from, what consumes its output)
  "
)
```

Spawn ALL in a single message. Wait for all to complete.

### 6d: Remove deselected agents

From the plan context, find agents marked for removal. For each:

```bash
rm agents/[agent-name].md
rm docs/[agent-name].md  # if exists
```

### 6e: Update README

Read `README.md` and update:
- The architecture diagram (Wave 1/2/3 agent lists)
- The agent discovery table
- The fork ideas table

### 6f: Report

```
Council implementation complete.

Created:
├─ research/*.md — [P] research files
├─ agents/*.md — [P] new agent definitions
├─ docs/*.md — [P] documentation pages
├─ Updated README.md

Removed:
├─ [R] deselected default agents

Run `/council:evaluate <project>` to test your configured council.
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never skip the conversation** — structured questions alone miss domain nuance
- **Never generate agents without research** — research makes the difference between generic and domain-specific
- **Never spawn agents sequentially** — all agents in a wave go in a single message for parallelism
- **Never modify existing agent definitions** — only create new ones and remove deselected ones
